            "text": "Overview\n\ue157\n\n\nArithmatex is an extension that preserves LaTeX math equations during the Markdown conversion process so that they can be used with \nMathJax\n. It searches for the patterns \n$\n...\n$\n and \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n for inline math, and \n$$\n...\n$$\n, \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but they each format can individually be disabled if desired.\n\n\nKeep in mind that some equations can make it through without Arithmatex fine.  Arithmatex is meant to \nensure\n they make it through.\n\n\nInput Format\n\ue157\n\n\nFor the \n$\n...\n$\n inline variant, it is expected that the opening token (\n$\n) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character.  This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00.  The previous statement requires no escaping of the \n$\n character.  But when needed, the \n$\n character can be escaped using \n\\$\n.\n\n\nFor block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type: \n$$\n, \n\\[\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end: \n$$\n, \n\\]\n, and \n\\end\n{}\n. A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line.\n\n\nOutput Format\n\ue157\n\n\nIf \ninsert_as_script\n is enabled, the math equations will be wrapped in a special MathJax script tag and embedded into the HTML. MathJax can already find these scripts, so there is no need to configure the \ntex2jax\n extension when setting up MathJax. The tag will be \nscript\n \ntype\n=\nmath/tex\n/\nscript\n for inline and \nscript\n \ntype\n=\nmath/tex; mode=display\n/\nscript\n for block. This is probably the most reliable HTML form, but if MathJax doesn't load, you don't get fallback text.  When \ninsert_as_script\n is enabled, \ntex_inline_wrap\n and \ntex_block_wrap\n are ignored.\n\n\nOn output, if \ninsert_as_script\n is \nFalse\n, the extension will escape necessary symbols and normalize all output to be wrapped in the more reliable \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n for inline math and \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n for block math. Then the wrapped content will be inserted into a \nspan\n and embedded into the HTML.  The span provides a container to keep MathJax from gathering multiple equations into one by mistake.  So, with the default settings, if in your Markdown you used \n$\n...\n$\n, it would be converted to \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n in the HTML. Blocks would respectively be normalized from \n$$\n...\n$$\n to \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n.  In the case of \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n, begins and ends will not be replaced, only wrapped\n\\[\n\\begin\n{}...\n\\end\n{}\n\\]\n. Normalization is provided as MathJax disables detection of \n$\n...\n$\n by default due to detection issues with money notation.  Since Arithmatex provides additional logic to curb issues with \n$\n, we allow it in the Markdown. If a different wrapper is desired, see \nOptions\n below to learn how to change the wrapper.\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninline_syntax\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\ndollar\n,\n \nround\n]\n\n\nSyntax to search for: dollar=\n$\n...\n$\n and round=\n\\(\n...\n\\)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock_syntax\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\ndollar\n,\n \nsquare\n,\n \nbegin\n]\n\n\nSyntax to search for: dollar=\n$\n...\n$\n, square=\n\\[\n...\n\\]\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntex_inline_wrap\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\n\\\\\n(\n,\n \n\\\\\n)\n]\n\n\nAn array containing the opening and closing portion of the wrap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntex_block_wrap\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\n\\\\\n[\n,\n \n\\\\\n]\n]\n\n\nAn array containing the opening and closing portion of the wrap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert_as_script\n\n\nbool\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nInstead of using the above wrap options, insert the equations in a \nmath/tex\n script. This form is the most reliable in HTML, but if the MathJax script fails to load, the user won't see any indication of the equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping Format\n\n\nVersion \n1.7.0\n: Arithmatex, when \ninsert_as_script\n is \nFalse\n, now runs the wrap options through an HTML escaper and then everything is wrapped in a \nspan\n.

It allows for the removal or acceptance of the critic modifications and modifies the source to reflect the rejection or approval (highlights and comments are stripped in both cases).  It also allows for visually displaying the changes in HTML output (\nmileage may vary\n).\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\nstring\n\n\nview\n\n\nview\n just parses the markup and displays it in its HTML equivalent rendering.  \naccept\n strips out the critic markup and replaces them with the suggested changes.  \nreject\n rejects all the suggestions and strips the critic markup out replacing it with the original.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations with Previewing Critic Markup\n\ue157\n\n\nParsing CriticMarkup is very straight forward.  If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well.  But when trying to render the edits visually \nand\n trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here: \nhttp://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup\n.\n\n\nThe Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.\n\n\nExamples\n\ue157\n\n\nMarkup\nExample\ndelete\ndelete\ninsert\ninsert\ndelete and replace with substitutions\ndelete and replace\nsubstitutions\nhighlight\nhighlight\ncomment\ntext\ncomment\n\n\n\nHere they are in action:\n\n\nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \n{--*incorrect*--}\n \nMarkdown.\n  \nI\n \nam\n \nadding\n \nthis\n{++ here.++}\n.\n  \nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \nmore\n \n{--text\n\n\n that I am removing--}\ntext.\n  \nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \neven\n \nmore\n \n{++text that I \n\n\n am ++}\nadding.\n{~~\n\n\n\n~\n  ~~}\nParagraph\n \nwas\n \ndeleted\n \nand\n \nreplaced\n \nwith\n \nsome\n \nspaces.\n{~~  ~\n\n\n\n~~}\nSpaces\n \nwere\n \nremoved\n \nand\n \na\n \nparagraph\n \nwas\n \nadded.\n\nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \na\n \ncomment\n \non\n \n{==some\n\n\n ==text== ==}{\nThis works quite well.

But when trying to render the edits visually  and  trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here:  http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup .  The Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.",

            "text": "Overview\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension adds support for inserting emojis via simple short names enclosed within colons: \n:short_name:\n.  This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to the Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements that represent the emoji.\n\n\nThere are a number of familiar emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of, and they differ slightly.  At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on two specific short name conventions. The first convention is from \nGemoji\n which is GitHub's open source solution that provides emojis in \nGFM\n.  The second is from \nEmojiOne\n which is another open source emoji solution.\n\n\nThe short name indexes simply provide easy to remember names mapped to the Unicode data. Custom emojis (like Gemoji's \n:octocat:\n) wold have no Unicode data associated with them and would only provide a long name.  While it may be thought that an index like Gemoji is only for GitHub emoji images, you could easily map EmojiOne images to the Gemoji short names and vice versa. You could even map \nTwemoji\n images to EmojiOne if desired.\n\n\nEmoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Most hosted emoji images follow the same pattern and are named after their Unicode code points separated by hyphens (minus things like zero width joiners and variation selectors).  This is true with EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji, to name a few.  The default output \nto_png\n could theoretically be used with the EmojiOne index to output valid PNG images for EmojiOne, GitHub, or Twemoji (assuming appropriate CDN or local source images were provided). With that said, some output formats may lend themselves better to assets that are available from a specific provider. For instance, EmojiOne provides SVG, PNG, and sprite assets, while others provide only PNG images.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, short name indexes are sourced from EmojiOne's and Gemoji's latest official tags. The index contains the emoji names, shortnames, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements.\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne and Gemoji licensing\n\n\nPyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne or Gemoji.

Both indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source. They can be used by passing in one of the two functions below via the \nemoji_index\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Indexes\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.emojione\n\n\n\n\nThis is the default function that is used and provides an index using the latest EmojiOne supported emojis (at the time of release).

All the generators can be used with the \nemojione\n index, but only two will work well with the \ngemoji\n index: \npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n and \npymdownx.emoji.to_alt\n. You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the \nemoji_generator\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Generators\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n\n\n\n\nThis is a general purpose generator and, by default, provides an EmojiOne CDN and GitHub CDN path(s).

The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator.\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nemoji_generator\n(\nindex\n,\n \nshortname\n,\n \nalias\n,\n \nuc\n,\n \nalt\n,\n \ntitle\n,\n \noptions\n,\n \nmd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe name of the selected emoji index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshortname\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe current short name.  This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalias\n\n\nstring\n\n\nIf the name specified in the document was an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under \nshortname\n.  This will be \nNone\n if the name used was not an alias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is a string of the Unicode values for the emoji.  This is used to reference emoji image names or for specifying class names etc., so it may not contain all the code points.  The string returned consists of each Unicode value represented as a hex value separated with hyphens.  Values such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and  U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 are stripped out.  So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be \nNone\n for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting \nalt\n.  This will be returned as either the Unicode characters, HTML entities, or the short name used.  See the \nalt\n setting for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is the title that can be used in image elements.  Depending on the global extension setting \ntitle\n, this will either return the long name, the short name, or \nNone\n.  See the \ntitle\n setting for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptions\n\n\ndictionary\n\n\nThis is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options.  This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmd\n\n\nclass\n\n\nThis is the Markdown class object.  This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class.  If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: \nmd.htmlStash.store(alt, safe=True)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Unicode emojis\n\n\nKeep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emojis like \n:octocat:\n that do not have Unicode code points.  \nuc\n and \nalt\n are affected by this and will return \nNone\n and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points.  For example \n:octocat:\n will just return \nNone\n for \nuc\n and \n:octocat:\n for \nalt\n.  If you are parsing an index with custom emojis, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing with MkDocs\n\ue157\n\n\nThis project uses these extensions with \nMkDocs\n to generate the documentation.  It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in Mkdoc's YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy.  The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object.  For instance, to specify the \nto_svg\n generator, you would simply reference it like this: \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n (or you could use your own custom module).\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \npymdownx.emoji\n:\n\n      \nemoji_generator\n:\n \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoji Index Updates\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension might at times be behind on having indexes built from the latest repositories. We try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the this project's issue page to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance.  Pull requests are also welcome.  The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do for a pull request.  See \nGenerating Emoji Indexes\n for more info.\n\n\nExamples\n\ue157\n\n\nCurrent examples are all rendered with EmojiOne.\n\n\nEmojiOne :smile: emojis are very useful :thumbsup:.\n\nYou can also escape `:` characters to escape the emoji: \\:smile:.\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne \n emojis are very useful \n.\n\n\nYou can also escape \n:\n characters to escape the emoji: :smile:.",

            "text": "The Emoji extension adds support for inserting emojis via simple short names enclosed within colons:  :short_name: .  This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to the Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements that represent the emoji.  There are a number of familiar emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of, and they differ slightly.  At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on two specific short name conventions. The first convention is from  Gemoji  which is GitHub's open source solution that provides emojis in  GFM .  The second is from  EmojiOne  which is another open source emoji solution.  The short name indexes simply provide easy to remember names mapped to the Unicode data. Custom emojis (like Gemoji's  :octocat: ) wold have no Unicode data associated with them and would only provide a long name.  While it may be thought that an index like Gemoji is only for GitHub emoji images, you could easily map EmojiOne images to the Gemoji short names and vice versa. You could even map  Twemoji  images to EmojiOne if desired.  Emoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Most hosted emoji images follow the same pattern and are named after their Unicode code points separated by hyphens (minus things like zero width joiners and variation selectors).  This is true with EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji, to name a few.  The default output  to_png  could theoretically be used with the EmojiOne index to output valid PNG images for EmojiOne, GitHub, or Twemoji (assuming appropriate CDN or local source images were provided). With that said, some output formats may lend themselves better to assets that are available from a specific provider. For instance, EmojiOne provides SVG, PNG, and sprite assets, while others provide only PNG images.  As previously mentioned, short name indexes are sourced from EmojiOne's and Gemoji's latest official tags. The index contains the emoji names, shortnames, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements.

This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.    alias  string  If the name specified in the document was an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under  shortname .  This will be  None  if the name used was not an alias.    uc  string  This is a string of the Unicode values for the emoji.  This is used to reference emoji image names or for specifying class names etc., so it may not contain all the code points.  The string returned consists of each Unicode value represented as a hex value separated with hyphens.  Values such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and  U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 are stripped out.  So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be  None  for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.    alt  string  This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting  alt .  This will be returned as either the Unicode characters, HTML entities, or the short name used.  See the  alt  setting for more info.    title  string  This is the title that can be used in image elements.  Depending on the global extension setting  title , this will either return the long name, the short name, or  None .  See the  title  setting for more info.    options  dictionary  This is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options.  This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults.    md  class  This is the Markdown class object.  This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class.  If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like:  md.htmlStash.store(alt, safe=True) .      Non-Unicode emojis  Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emojis like  :octocat:  that do not have Unicode code points.   uc  and  alt  are affected by this and will return  None  and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points.  For example  :octocat:  will just return  None  for  uc  and  :octocat:  for  alt .  If you are parsing an index with custom emojis, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.",

Optionally, you can use either of these extensions and disable Pygments support to use your preferred JavaScript highlighter.\n\n\nIf using Pygments, you will also need to provide your preferred Pygments style. If using a JavaScript highlighter, you will have to read that highlighter's documentation to learn how to setup and style your code blocks appropriately.\n\n\nFor those looking for a GitHub theme, there is no GitHub style included with this extension. You are most likely able to find a suitable theme online by searching. Presently, there are GitHub styles found at the \npymdown-styles\n repository which contains the original Pygments GitHub style (\ngithub\n) and the GitHub 2014 style (\ngithub2014\n) which GitHub used before they abandoned Pygments for their own in-house highlighter. The listed themes might not always be available, and may not actually be close to current GitHub syntax highlighting.\n\n\nGitHub Like Slugs\n\ue157\n\n\nThe default slugify that Python Markdown uses isn't very much like GitHub's as it just removes all Unicode. But, at the time of writing this, the \nuslugify\n slugify provided by PyMdown Extensions is pretty close in the way it handles Unicode in slugs. By passing in the \npymdownx.slugs.uslugify\n function via \nToc\n's slugify parameter, you can alter the slugs to be GitHub like. If GitHub changes their slugs, you can always write your own to be more like theirs.\n\n\nAs mentioned before, the GitHub extension does not intend to provide a 1:1 match of \nGFM\n. There are small differences that will never be directly addressed. With slugs, there is one difference between GitHub's and PyMdown Extensions \nuslugify\n, and that is with duplicate headers. GitHub appends a number to duplicate headers with a hyphen: \n-1\n. Python Markdown (through the \nToc\n extension) appends a number to duplicate headers with an underscore \n_1\n. Unfortunately, a slug function cannot simply override this duplicate behavior as that behavior is controlled within the \nToc\n extension. There are no plans at this time to write a \nToc\n extension to replace the default one as a 1:1 match in behavior is not the end goal.\n\n\nGitHub Emoji Configuration\n\ue157\n\n\nThis is for informational purposes in case you wish to configure GitHub style emojis outside of the GitHub Extension. This is the full, default setup used to get GitHub emoji images.  This is valid at the time of writing this. GitHub uses Gemoji to provide their emoji, but GitHub also constantly tweaks how they do things, so in time this may render differently than what they actually do. This should provide emojis for as long as the CDNs are valid.\n\n\nimport\n \npymdownx.emoji\n\n\n\nextension_configs\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \npymdownx.emoji\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nemoji_index\n:\n \npymdownx\n.\nemoji\n.\ngemoji\n,\n\n        \nemoji_generator\n:\n \npymdownx\n.\nemoji\n.\nto_png\n,\n\n        \nalt\n:\n \nshort\n,\n\n        \noptions\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nattributes\n:\n \n{\n\n                \nalign\n:\n \nabsmiddle\n,\n\n                \nheight\n:\n \n20px\n,\n\n                \nwidth\n:\n \n20px\n\n            \n},\n\n            \nimage_path\n:\n \nhttps://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/\n,\n\n            \nnon_standard_image_path\n:\n \nhttps://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\nIf you wish to configure the individual extensions included via this extensions, you can configure them by placing that sub extension's settings under a setting value that equals the sub extensions name.\n\n\nextension_configs\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \npymdownx.github\n:\n \n{\n\n        \npymdownx.tilde\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nsubscript\n:\n \nTrue\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}",

If using Pygments, you will also need to provide your preferred Pygments style.

For those looking for a GitHub theme, there is no GitHub style included with this extension. You are most likely able to find a suitable theme online by searching. Presently, there are GitHub styles found at the  pymdown-styles  repository which contains the original Pygments GitHub style ( github ) and the GitHub 2014 style ( github2014 ) which GitHub used before they abandoned Pygments for their own in-house highlighter.

If GitHub changes their slugs, you can always write your own to be more like theirs.  As mentioned before, the GitHub extension does not intend to provide a 1:1 match of  GFM . There are small differences that will never be directly addressed. With slugs, there is one difference between GitHub's and PyMdown Extensions  uslugify , and that is with duplicate headers. GitHub appends a number to duplicate headers with a hyphen:  -1 . Python Markdown (through the  Toc  extension) appends a number to duplicate headers with an underscore  _1 . Unfortunately, a slug function cannot simply override this duplicate behavior as that behavior is controlled within the  Toc  extension.

A key or combination of key presses is surrounded by \n++\n with each key press separated with a single \n+\n.  For instance, if we wanted to represent \nCtrl + Alt + Delete\n, we could just format our keys like this: \n++ctrl+alt+delete++\n \n \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nAlt\n\uff0b\nDel\n.\n\n\nFormatting\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default, Keys outputs keys in the form (separator \nspan\ns will be omitted if a separator is not provided via the \noptions\n):\n\n\nspan\n \nclass\n=\nkeys\n\n  \nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkey-ctrl\nCtrl\n/\nkbd\n\n  \nspan\n+\n/\nspan\n\n  \nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkey-alt\nAlt\n/\nkbd\n\n  \nspan\n+\n/\nspan\n\n  \nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkey-delete\nDelete\n/\nkbd\n\n\n/\nspan\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the wrapper \nspan\n has the class \nkeys\n applied to it.  This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key press has its own special key class assigned to it in the form \nkey-\nkey name\n. These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper \nkeys\n class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the \nkey-map index\n.\n\n\nIf you would like to generate a key which isn't in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special \noption\n.  But if you don't need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time special key, you can just insert it directly by quoting the text you want displayed instead of a key name: \n++ctrl+alt+\nMy Special Key\n++\n \n \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nAlt\n\uff0b\nMy Special Key\n. You can also enter HTML entities: \n++ctrl+alt+\nUuml;\n++\n \n \nCtrl\n\uff0b\nAlt\n\uff0b\n\u00dc\n if desired.\n\n\nStrict \nKBD\n Output\n\ue157\n\n\nAccording to HTML5 spec on \nkbd\n, a literal key input, is represented by a \nkbd\n wrapped the other \nkbd\ns:\n\n\nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkeys\n\n  \nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkey-ctrl\nCtrl\n/\nkbd\n\n  \nspan\n+\n/\nspan\n\n  \nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkey-alt\nAlt\n/\nkbd\n\n  \nspan\n+\n/\nspan\n\n  \nkbd\n \nclass\n=\nkey-delete\nDelete\n/\nkbd\n\n\n/\nkbd\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not how many people traditionally use \nkbd\ns for key inputs, but if you are a stickler for rules, you can enable the \nstrict\n option to use a more \"proper\" format.\n\n\nKey-Map Index\n\ue157\n\n\nBy default, Keys provides a key-map index for English US keyboards.

A key or combination of key presses is surrounded by  ++  with each key press separated with a single  + .

This is so you can target it or the elements under it with CSS. Each recognized key press has its own special key class assigned to it in the form  key- key name . These individual key classes are great if you want to show special modifier key symbols before the key text (which is done in this documentation). The wrapper  keys  class can be customized with options, and the individual key classes are generated from the  key-map index .  If you would like to generate a key which isn't in the key index, you can extend the key map via a special  option .  But if you don't need a key with a special class generated, or you need a way to quickly enter a one time special key, you can just insert it directly by quoting the text you want displayed instead of a key name:  ++ctrl+alt+ My Special Key ++     Ctrl \uff0b Alt \uff0b My Special Key . You can also enter HTML entities:  ++ctrl+alt+ Uuml; ++     Ctrl \uff0b Alt \uff0b \u00dc  if desired.",

It searches the final output stripping things like  style ,  id ,  class , and  on name  attributes from HTML tags.  It also removes HTML comments.  If you have no desire to see these, this can strip them out.  Though it does its best to be loaded at the very end of the process, it helps to include this one last when loading up your extensions.  If needed, plain HTML can also be configured to strip out just comments or just attributes etc.  Because comments aren't stripped until the end in a post-processing step, they are present throughout the entire Markdown conversion process and could possibly affect parsing, so be careful how you generally insert comments.   Warning  This is not meant to be a sanitizer for HTML.  This is just meant to try and strip out style, script, classes, etc. to provide a plain HTML output for the times this is desired; this is not meant as a security extension.

If start is 3 backticks, the fence will end with 3 backticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart and end fence boundaries must be aligned to the same indentation level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent between fences must be indented at least the same amount as the start and end boundaries.

If Pygments is not installed, code blocks will be wrapped in \ncode\n and \npre\n elements and given a class of \nlanguage-\nspecified_language\n (if a language specifier was given) so that a JavaScript highlighter can style them.\n\n\nIf CodeHilite is configured, it's settings will be used to configure highlighting, but CodeHilite support is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is recommended to instead use \npymdownx.highlight\n extension. If \npymdownx.highlight\n is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored.\n\n\nWhen using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either \n```\n or \n~~~\n). So if we wanted to specify Python as the syntax to highlight with, we could use the following syntax below. Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers.\n\n\n```python\nimport foo.bar\n```\n\n\n\n\nShowing Line Numbers\n\ue157\n\n\nLine numbers are provided via Pygments and can either be shown per code block or globally for all. To show globally via CodeHilite or \npymdownx.highlight\n, you must set \nlinenums\n to \nTrue\n in the respective extension.\n\n\nTo set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option \nlinenums=\n1\n. The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted.  Valid line numbers are n \n 0.  If \nlinenums\n is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block.\n\n\n``` linenums=\n1\n\nimport foo.bar\n```\n\n\n\n\nPygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n \n 1, will print only every n\nth\n line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class \nspecial\n. If the special parameter is set to a number n \n 0, every n\nth\n line number is given the CSS class \nspecial\n.\n\n\nSo to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.\n\n\n``` linenums=\n1 2\n\n\nSome file.\n\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\nTo set every other line as special, you must set the third \nlinenums\n option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n \n 0.\n\n\n``` linenums=\n1 1 2\n\n\nSome file.\n\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\nFor JavaScript libraries, a class of \nlinenums\n is written to the block.  This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter.  It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this.\n\n\nHighlighting Lines\n\ue157\n\n\nVia Pygments, certain lines can be specified for highlighting.  This is done by specifying a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present).  The setting is named \nhl_lines\n and the value should be the targeted line numbers separated by spaces. Line numbers are always referenced starting at 1 ignoring what the line number is labeled as when showing line numbers.\n\n\n``` hl_lines=\n1 3\n\n\nSome file.\n\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\n``` hl_lines=\n1 3\n linenums=\n2\n\n\nSome file.\n\nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```\n\n\n\n\nCustom Fences\n\ue157\n\n\nSuperFences allows defining custom fences for special purposes. For example, SuperFences defines two default custom fences (which can be removed if desired) called \nflow\n and \nsequence\n, for flowcharts and sequence diagrams respectively. The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. Custom fences are created via the \ncustom_fences\n option.  \ncustom_fences\n takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence. The dictionaries requires the following keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeys\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n\n\nThe language name that is specified when using the fence in Markdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclass\n\n\nThe class name assigned to the HTML element when converting from Markdown to HTML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nformat\n\n\nA function that formats the HTML output.  Should return a string as HTML.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperFences provides two format functions by default, but you can always write your own:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat\nFunction\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuperfences.fence_code_format\n\n\nPlaces the HTML escaped content of the fence under a \npre\ncode\n block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsuperfences.fence_div_format\n\n\nPlaces the HTML escaped content of the fence under a \ndiv\n block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUML Diagram Examples\n\ue157\n\n\nThis example illustrates how this document uses the \ncustom_fences\n option to do UML diagrams.  Out of the box, SuperFences use the default settings for \ncustom_fences\n for the purpose of including UML. The settings below show the default settings, which define two new custom languages called \nflow\n and \nsequence\n. The \nflow\n and \nsequence\n fences will pass the content through the \nsuperfences.fence_code_format\n format function which will wrap the content in \npre\ncode\n blocks and attach the class \numl-flowchart\n or \numl-sequence-diagram\n to the respective \npre\n block. \nsuperfences.fence_div_format\n could just as easily be used to wrap the content in a \ndiv\n instead, or a new custom function could have been written and used.\n\n\ncustom_fences\n \n=\n \n[\n\n    \n{\nname\n:\n \nflow\n,\n \nclass\n:\n \numl-flowchart\n,\n \nformat\n:\n \nsuperfences\n.\nfence_code_format\n},\n\n    \n{\nname\n:\n \nsequence\n,\n \nclass\n:\n \numl-sequence-diagram\n,\n \nformat\n:\n \nsuperfences\n.\nfence_code_format\n}\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nAs defined above, the custom UML diagrams are recognized when defining a fenced code block with either the language \nflow\n or \nsequence\n.  When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes \numl-flowchart\n or \numl-sequence-diagram\n. The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser. Below is an example of defining a flowchart fence.\n\n\n```flow\nst=\nstart: Start:\nhttp://www.google.com[blank]\ne=\nend:\nhttp://www.google.com\nop1=\noperation: My Operation\nsub1=\nsubroutine: My Subroutine\ncond=\ncondition: Yes\nor No?:\nhttp://www.google.com\nio=\ninputoutput: catch something...\n\nst-\nop1-\ncond\ncond(yes)-\nio-\ne\ncond(no)-\nsub1(right)-\nop1\n```\n\n\n\n\nFor this example we will use the \nflowchart.js\n and \nsequence-diagram.js\n JavaScript libraries to render the flow charts in the browser. This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below.\n\n\n\n\nflowcharts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nraphael.js\n\n\nflowchart.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsequence diagrams\n\n\n\n\nMinimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this).\n\n\n\n\nraphael.js\n\n\nunderscore.js\n\n\nsequence-diagram.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice):\n\n\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js\n/\nscript\n\n\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js\n/\nscript\n\n\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js\n/\nscript\n\n\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js\n/\nscript\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert.  Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the \numl-flowchart\n class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the \numl-sequence-diagram\n class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes \numl-flowchart\n and \numl-sequence-diagram\n. The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content.  It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence.\n\n\nIn the below example we create an \nonReady\n function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded.  We create a \nconvertUML\n function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter.  We then call \nonReady\n and feed it a callback function that will execute \nconvertUML\n for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that \nconvertUML\n can handle both the \npre\ncode\n format or the \ndiv\n format we mentioned earlier.\n\n\n(\nfunction\n \n(\ndocument\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \nconvertUML\n(\nclassName\n,\n \nconverter\n,\n \nsettings\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nvar\n \ncharts\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\nquerySelectorAll\n(\npre.\n \n+\n \nclassName\n \n+\n \n,div.\n \n+\n \nclassName\n),\n\n            \narr\n \n=\n \n[],\n\n            \ni\n,\n \nj\n,\n \nmaxItem\n,\n \ndiagaram\n,\n \ntext\n,\n \ncurNode\n,\n\n            \nisPre\n;\n\n\n        \n// Is there a settings object?\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nsettings\n \n===\n \nvoid\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nsettings\n \n=\n \n{};\n\n        \n}\n\n\n        \n// Make sure we are dealing with an array\n\n        \nfor\n(\ni\n \n=\n \n0\n,\n \nmaxItem\n \n=\n \ncharts\n.\nlength\n;\n \ni\n \n \nmaxItem\n;\n \ni\n++\n)\n \narr\n.\npush\n(\ncharts\n[\ni\n]);\n\n\n        \n// Find the UML source element and get the text\n\n        \nfor\n \n(\ni\n \n=\n \n0\n,\n \nmaxItem\n \n=\n \narr\n.\nlength\n;\n \ni\n \n \nmaxItem\n;\n \ni\n++\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nisPre\n \n=\n \narr\n[\ni\n].\ntagName\n.\ntoLowerCase\n()\n \n==\n \npre\n;\n\n            \nif\n \n(\nisPre\n)\n \n{\n\n                \n// Handles \npre\ncode\n\n                \nchildEl\n \n=\n \narr\n[\ni\n].\nfirstChild\n;\n\n                \nparentEl\n \n=\n \nchildEl\n.\nparentNode\n;\n\n                \ntext\n \n=\n \n;\n\n                \nfor\n \n(\nj\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \nj\n \n \nchildEl\n.\nchildNodes\n.\nlength\n;\n \nj\n++\n)\n \n{\n\n                    \ncurNode\n \n=\n \nchildEl\n.\nchildNodes\n[\nj\n];\n\n                    \nwhitespace\n \n=\n \n/^\\s*$/\n;\n\n                    \nif\n \n(\ncurNode\n.\nnodeName\n \n===\n \n#text\n \n \n!\n(\nwhitespace\n.\ntest\n(\ncurNode\n.\nnodeValue\n)))\n \n{\n\n                        \ntext\n \n=\n \ncurNode\n.\nnodeValue\n;\n\n                        \nbreak\n;\n\n                    \n}\n\n                \n}\n\n                \n// Do UML conversion and replace source\n\n                \nel\n \n=\n \ndocument\n.\ncreateElement\n(\ndiv\n);\n\n                \nel\n.\nclassName\n \n=\n \nclassName\n;\n\n                \nparentEl\n.\nparentNode\n.\ninsertBefore\n(\nel\n,\n \nparentEl\n);\n\n                \nparentEl\n.\nparentNode\n.\nremoveChild\n(\nparentEl\n);\n\n            \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n                \n// Handles \ndiv\n\n                \nel\n \n=\n \narr\n[\ni\n];\n\n                \ntext\n \n=\n \nel\n.\ntextContent\n \n||\n \nel\n.\ninnerText\n;\n\n                \nif\n \n(\nel\n.\ninnerText\n){\n\n                    \nel\n.\ninnerText\n \n=\n \n;\n\n                \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n                    \nel\n.\ntextContent\n \n=\n \n;\n\n                \n}\n\n            \n}\n\n            \ndiagram\n \n=\n \nconverter\n.\nparse\n(\ntext\n);\n\n            \ndiagram\n.\ndrawSVG\n(\nel\n,\n \nsettings\n);\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n};\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nonReady\n(\nfn\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nif\n \n(\ndocument\n.\naddEventListener\n)\n \n{\n\n            \ndocument\n.\naddEventListener\n(\nDOMContentLoaded\n,\n \nfn\n);\n\n        \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n            \ndocument\n.\nattachEvent\n(\nonreadystatechange\n,\n \nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n                \nif\n \n(\ndocument\n.\nreadyState\n \n===\n \ninteractive\n)\n\n                    \nfn\n();\n\n            \n});\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nonReady\n(\nfunction\n(){\n\n        \nconvertUML\n(\numl-flowchart\n,\n \nflowchart\n);\n\n        \nconvertUML\n(\numl-sequence-diagram\n,\n \nDiagram\n,\n \n{\ntheme\n:\n \nsimple\n});\n\n    \n});\n\n\n})(\ndocument\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\ue157\n\n\nThis extension suffers from the same issues that the original fenced block extension suffers from.  Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute \nmarkdown='1'\n.  But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks.\n\n\nSuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box.  It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes).  Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible.\n\n\nSuperFences works best when following the guidelines.  If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered.\n\n\nFor the reasons above, the nested fences feature really is just a workaround.  But for a lot of people, this functionality is more than sufficient.\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisable_indented_code_blocks\n\n\nbool\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nDisables Python Markdown's indented code block parsing.

It is recommended to instead use  pymdownx.highlight  extension. If  pymdownx.highlight  is included and configured, CodeHilite will be ignored.  When using fenced code blocks, you can specify a specific syntax language to highlight with by specifying the language name directly after the opening tokens (either  ```  or  ~~~ ). So if we wanted to specify Python as the syntax to highlight with, we could use the following syntax below. Whether using Pygments or some other JavaScript highlighter, please consult your highlighter's documentation for recognized language syntax specifiers.  ```python\nimport foo.bar\n```",

To show globally via CodeHilite or  pymdownx.highlight , you must set  linenums  to  True  in the respective extension.  To set line numbers per code block, you can specify a special setting directly after the opening tokens (and language if present). Simply specify the starting line line number with option  linenums= 1 . The setting is followed by the equal sign and the value must be quoted.  Valid line numbers are n   0.  If  linenums  is enabled globally, this will just control the starting line shown in the block.  ``` linenums= 1 \nimport foo.bar\n```  Pygments also has a few additional options in regards to line numbers. One is \"line step\" which, if set to a number n   1, will print only every n th  line number. The other option is a setting that can mark line numbers as \"special\" with a span and class  special . If the special parameter is set to a number n   0, every n th  line number is given the CSS class  special .  So to set showing only every other line number, we could do the following. Line options are separated by a space, and \"line step\" is always the second option, so you must specify line start before line step.  ``` linenums= 1 2  Some file. \nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```  To set every other line as special, you must set the third  linenums  option (specify line start and step before it). Special must be a value of n   0.  ``` linenums= 1 1 2  Some file. \nimport foo.bar\nimport boo.baz\nimport foo.bar.baz\n```  For JavaScript libraries, a class of  linenums  is written to the block.  This may or may not be leveraged by your chosen highlighter.  It is uncertain at this time whether line number support for JavaScript highlighters will be enhanced beyond this.",

For example, SuperFences defines two default custom fences (which can be removed if desired) called  flow  and  sequence , for flowcharts and sequence diagrams respectively. The default custom fences simply preserve the content between the fences so a JavaScript UML library can convert the content and render the UML. Custom fences are created via the  custom_fences  option.   custom_fences  takes an array of dictionaries where each dictionary defines a custom fence.

            "text": "This example illustrates how this document uses the  custom_fences  option to do UML diagrams.  Out of the box, SuperFences use the default settings for  custom_fences  for the purpose of including UML. The settings below show the default settings, which define two new custom languages called  flow  and  sequence . The  flow  and  sequence  fences will pass the content through the  superfences.fence_code_format  format function which will wrap the content in  pre code  blocks and attach the class  uml-flowchart  or  uml-sequence-diagram  to the respective  pre  block.  superfences.fence_div_format  could just as easily be used to wrap the content in a  div  instead, or a new custom function could have been written and used.  custom_fences   =   [ \n     { name :   flow ,   class :   uml-flowchart ,   format :   superfences . fence_code_format }, \n     { name :   sequence ,   class :   uml-sequence-diagram ,   format :   superfences . fence_code_format }  ]   As defined above, the custom UML diagrams are recognized when defining a fenced code block with either the language  flow  or  sequence .  When they are converted, the HTML element containing this content will have the respective classes  uml-flowchart  or  uml-sequence-diagram . The format function we used in this example only escapes the content to be included in HTML. We will rely on JavaScript libraries to render our flowcharts/diagrams in the browser. Below is an example of defining a flowchart fence.  ```flow\nst= start: Start: http://www.google.com[blank]\ne= end: http://www.google.com\nop1= operation: My Operation\nsub1= subroutine: My Subroutine\ncond= condition: Yes\nor No?: http://www.google.com\nio= inputoutput: catch something...\n\nst- op1- cond\ncond(yes)- io- e\ncond(no)- sub1(right)- op1\n```  For this example we will use the  flowchart.js  and  sequence-diagram.js  JavaScript libraries to render the flow charts in the browser. This extension does not provide these JavaScript libraries; you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for your custom fences. If you wish to follow along with this example to enable UML, see the requirements below.   flowcharts    raphael.js  flowchart.js    sequence diagrams   Minimum requirements for the latest version available via CDN (at the time of writing this).   raphael.js  underscore.js  sequence-diagram.js     All of the above mentioned libraries can be included using CDNs (you can use the version of your choice):  script   src = https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/raphael/2.2.7/raphael.min.js / script  script   src = https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js / script  script   src = https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/js-sequence-diagrams/1.0.6/sequence-diagram-min.js / script  script   src = https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowchart/1.6.5/flowchart.min.js / script   Simply including the libraries above is not enough as these libraries need to be pointed at the elements they need to convert.  Also, we need to configure the libraries with the settings we would like.  As mentioned earlier, our flowchart elements have the  uml-flowchart  class assigned to them, and the sequence diagram elements have the  uml-sequence-diagram  class assigned to them. Below shows an example script to convert the UML diagrams for both flowcharts and sequence diagrams using the listed libraries above. This script will target the elements with the classes  uml-flowchart  and  uml-sequence-diagram . The script will pass the content to the correct library to render the content.  It will then insert the rendered UML and remove the original source. This is just an example, and you are not required to use the following script. You are free to modify the example script or write your own to suite your specific custom fence.  In the below example we create an  onReady  function to execute the conversion when the HTML is loaded.  We create a  convertUML  function that takes the class name to search for, the converter to use, and a settings object to feed into the converter.  We then call  onReady  and feed it a callback function that will execute  convertUML  for flowcharts and for sequence diagrams. Notice that  convertUML  can handle both the  pre code  format or the  div  format we mentioned earlier.  ( function   ( document )   { \n     function   convertUML ( className ,   converter ,   settings )   { \n         var   charts   =   document . querySelectorAll ( pre.   +   className   +   ,div.   +   className ), \n             arr   =   [], \n             i ,   j ,   maxItem ,   diagaram ,   text ,   curNode , \n             isPre ; \n\n         // Is there a settings object? \n         if   ( settings   ===   void   0 )   { \n             settings   =   {}; \n         } \n\n         // Make sure we are dealing with an array \n         for ( i   =   0 ,   maxItem   =   charts . length ;   i     maxItem ;   i ++ )   arr . push ( charts [ i ]); \n\n         // Find the UML source element and get the text \n         for   ( i   =   0 ,   maxItem   =   arr . length ;   i     maxItem ;   i ++ )   { \n             isPre   =   arr [ i ]. tagName . toLowerCase ()   ==   pre ; \n             if   ( isPre )   { \n                 // Handles  pre code \n                 childEl   =   arr [ i ]. firstChild ; \n                 parentEl   =   childEl . parentNode ; \n                 text   =   ; \n                 for   ( j   =   0 ;   j     childEl . childNodes . length ;   j ++ )   { \n                     curNode   =   childEl . childNodes [ j ]; \n                     whitespace   =   /^\\s*$/ ; \n                     if   ( curNode . nodeName   ===   #text     !

Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute  markdown='1' .  But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks.  SuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box.  It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes).  Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible.  SuperFences works best when following the guidelines.  If the guidelines are not followed, odd results may be encountered.

The PyMdown Extensions project utilizes the flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules).  When in doubt follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding or modifying files. existing files.  Listed below are the modules used:\n\n\n\n\nflake8\n\n\nflake8_docstrings\n\n\npep8-naming\n\n\n\n\nFlake8 can be run directly via the command line from the root of the project.\n\n\nflake8\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Documents\n\ue157\n\n\nDocuments are in Markdown (with with some additional syntax) and converted to HTML via Python Markdown and this extension bundle. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed:\n\n\n\n\nPython Markdown\n: the Markdown parser.\n\n\nMkDocs\n: the document site generator.\n\n\nMaterial\n: a material theme for MkDocs.\n\n\nPyMdown Extensions: this Python Markdown extension bundle.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to build and preview the documents, just run the following from the root of the project and you should be able to view the docs at \nlocalhost:8000\n in your browser (assuming you have the dependencies installed).\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\nSpell Checking Documents\n\ue157\n\n\nDuring validation we build the docs and run a spell checker on them.  The spell checker script uses \nAspell\n.  Currently this project uses the latest Aspell.  As the latest Aspell is not available on Windows, it is not expected that everyone will install and run Aspell locally.  In order to perform the spell check, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in the your system path. To initiate the spell check run the following command from the root of the project:\n\n\npython spelling.py\n\n\n\n\nIt should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found.  If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in \n.dictionary\n in the root of the project.\n\n\nValidation Tests\n\ue157\n\n\nIn order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with \npytest\n. There are currently two kinds of tests: syntax and targeted.  To run these tests, you can use the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\ue157\n\n\nSyntax tests are essentially text files containing Markdown. They are found under \ntests/extensions\n.  \ntest_syntax.py\n scans all the files and converts the files to HTML with the extensions and options defined in \ntests/extensions/tests.yml\n.  They are then compared to the current stored HTML output.  If the two differ, the test fails.\n\n\nTo run \nonly\n these tests, from the root of the project run the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target syntax\n\n\n\n\nYou could also run them directly with:\n\n\npy.test tests/test_syntax.py\n\n\n\n\nTo run a specific syntax test:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target syntax --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt\n\n\n\n\nTo accept the differences in tests due to a change(s) you made, you can run the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --update\n\n\n\n\nTo update and accept the differences in a single test:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --update --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt\n\n\n\n\nTargeted\n\ue157\n\n\nTargeted tests are unit tests that target specific areas in the code and exercises them to ensure proper functionality.  These tests are found in \ntest_targeted.py\n.\n\n\nYou can run \nonly\n these tests from the root of the project with:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target targeted\n\n\n\n\nYou could also run them directly with:\n\n\npy.test tests/test_targeted.py\n\n\n\n\nRunning Validation With Tox\n\ue157\n\n\nTox\n is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell).  You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same.\n\n\nFirst, you need to have Tox installed:\n\n\npip install tox\n\n\n\n\nBy running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests.  See \ntox.ini\n to learn more.\n\n\ntox\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail.  You can ignore those.  Spelling will also fail if you don't have the correct version of Aspell.\n\n\nTo target a specific environment to test, you use the \n-e\n option to select the environment of interest.  To select lint:\n\n\ntox -elint\n\n\n\n\nTo select PY27 unit tests (or other versions \n change accordingly):\n\n\ntox -epy27-unittests\n\n\n\n\nTo select spelling:\n\n\ntox -espelling\n\n\n\n\nCode Coverage\n\ue157\n\n\nWhen running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the \ncoverage\n module.  Coverage is run on each \npyxx-unittests\n environment.  If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data:\n\n\ncoverage erase\n\n\n\n\nThen run each unit test environment to and coverage will be calculated. All the data from each run is merged together.  HTML is output for each file in \n.tox/pyXX-unittests/tmp\n.  You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing.\n\n\nYou can checkout \ntox.ini\n to see how this is accomplished.\n\n\nGenerating Emoji Indexes\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension has emoji indexes generated from the source of Gemoji and EmojiOne.  Below is the process for auto-generating these indexes.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have \nRequests\n installed: \npip install requests\n.\n\n\nFork the repository and checkout to your machine.\n\n\nNavigate to the root of the project.\n\n\nCall the generator script: \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --gemoji\n or \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --emojione\n.  It will prompt you to select a tag to download.  Please pull the latest \nofficial\n tag.  Please don't pull experimental tags.  This should update the indexes.\n\n\nThen you want to update the tests.\n\n\nForce the tests to update via \npython run_tests.py --update\n.\n\n\n\n\nNothing is fool proof.  If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence).  If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.",
