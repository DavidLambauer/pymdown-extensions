If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the critic extension will work quite well.  But when trying to render the edits visually \nand\n trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here: \nhttp://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup\n.\n\n\nThe critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkup\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{--delete--}\n\n\ndelete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{++delete++}\n\n\ninsert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{~~delete and replace~\nsubstitutions~~}\n\n\ndelete and replace\nsubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{==highlight==}\n\n\nhighlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\ncomment\n}\n\n\ntext\ncomment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere they are in action:\n\n\nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \n{--*incorrect*--}\n \nMarkdown.\n  \nI\n \nam\n \nadding\n \nthis\n{++ here.++}\n.\n  \nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \nmore\n \n{--text\n\n\nthat I am removing--}\ntext.\n  \nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \neven\n \nmore\n \n{++text that I\n\n\nam ++}\nadding.\n{~~\n\n\n\n~\n  ~~}\nParagraph\n \nwas\n \ndeleted\n \nand\n \nreplaced\n \nwith\n \nsome\n \nspaces.\n{~~  ~\n\n\n\n~~}\nSpaces\n \nwere\n \nremoved\n \nand\n \na\n \nparagraph\n \nwas\n \nadded.\n\nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \na\n \ncomment\n \non\n \n{==some\n\n\n==text== ==}{\nThis works quite well.

The critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.",

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nThe Emoji extension adds support for inserting emojis or special emoji tags linked to images that are either local or on a CDN via the syntax \n:emoji:\n.  Currently, the Emoji extension adds support for two different emoji providers. The first emoji provider is \nGemoji\n.  Gemoji is Github's open source solution that provides emojis for \nGFM\n.  The second provider is \nEmojiOne\n which is another open source emoji solution.\n\n\nAn emoji index is built for both Gemoji and EmojiOne from their respective repository source.  The indexes contain the emoji's names, shortnames, values, etc.; everything needed to insert emoji or specially crafted HTML elements to reference emoji images.\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne and Gemoji licensing\n\n\nPymdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne or Gemoji.  The indexes generated from their sources are covered under their respective licensing.  When using their images or CSS, please see their licensing terms to ensure proper usage and attributions.\n\n\nEmojiOne: \nhttp://emojione.com/licensing/\n\nGemoji: \nhttps://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/LICENSE\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nemoji_index\n\n\nfunction\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.emojione\n\n\nA function that returns the index to use when parsing \n:emoji:\n syntax.

Emoji was written to be much more flexible.  If you have a desire to configure the output to be like the legacy GithubEmoji extension, you can use the settings below. To learn more about the settings used, continue reading the documentation.\n\n\nimport\n \npymdownx.emoji\n\n\n\ngithub_emulation_parameters\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \nemoji_index\n:\n \npymdownx\n.\nemoji\n.\ngemoji\n,\n\n    \nemoji_generator\n:\n \npymdownx\n.\nemoji\n.\nto_png\n,\n\n    \nalt\n:\n \nshort\n,\n\n    \noptions\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nattributes\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nalign\n:\n \nabsmiddle\n,\n\n            \nheight\n:\n \n20px\n,\n\n            \nwidth\n:\n \n20px\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Emoji Indexes\n\n\nBy default, Emoji provides two indexes: \nemojione\n and \ngemoji\n.  Both indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source. They can be used by passing in one of the two functions below via the \nemoji_index\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Indexes\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.emojione\n\n\n\n\nThis is the default function that is used and provides an index using the latest EmojiOne supported emojis (at the time of release).  You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following:\n\n\n \nimport\n \npymdownx.emoji1_db\n \nas\n \ne1db\n\n\n \ne1db\n.\nversion\n\n\nv2.2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.gemoji\n\n\n\n\nThis function provides an index of the latest Gemoji supported emoji (at the time of release). You can always find out what tag it was built with by doing the following:\n\n\n \nimport\n \npymdownx.gemoji_db\n \nas\n \ngmdb\n\n\n \ngmdb\n.\nversion\n\n\nv3.0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Emoji Generators\n\n\nEmoji provides six default emoji generators.  All the generators can be used with the \nemojione\n index, but only two will work well with the \ngemoji\n index: \npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n and \npymdownx.emoji.to_alt\n. They can be used by passing in one of the functions below via the \nemoji_generator\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Generators\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n\n\n\n\nThis generator was written to do PNG outputs for both Gemoji and EmojiOne.  This outputs the emoji as a PNG image in the form of:\n\n\nimg\n \nalt\n=\n\ud83d\ude04\n \nclass\n=\nemojione\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/png/1f604.png\n \ntitle\n=\n:smile:\n \n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstr\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nSpecifies the class(es) to be used in the img element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_path\n\n\nstr\n\n\nCDN for the default index used\n\n\nThis can be either a local path, or it can be a CDN.  By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne and Gemoji depending on which index is being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnon_standard_image_path\n\n\nstr\n\n\nCDN for the default index used\n\n\nThis can be either a local path, or it can be a CDN. Currently, only Gemoji's non-standard emojis take advantage of this as the Github CDN alters the path slightly for its non-Unicode emoji.  By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for Gemoji.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\ndict\n\n\n{}\n\n\nA dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dict keys are the attribute names and dict values are the attribute values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n\n\n\n\nThis generator was written to output EmojiOne SVG images.  This outputs the emoji as a SVG image in the form of:\n\n\nimg\n \nalt\n=\n\ud83d\ude04\n \nclass\n=\nemojione\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/emojione/assets/svg/1f604.svg\n \ntitle\n=\n:smile:\n \n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstr\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nSpecifies the class(es) to be used in the img element.

By default, an appropriate CDN is provided for EmojiOne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\ndict\n\n\n{}\n\n\nA dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dict keys are the attribute names and dict values are the attribute values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_png_sprite\n\n\n\n\nThis generator was written to support PNG sprite output for EmojiOne.  It is expected that this will be used in conjunction with the the official EmojiOne CSS.  You can include the CSS from the CDN in your document.  Example CDN for version 2.2.7: \nhttps://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.css\n. This outputs the emoji as a span in the form below.  The CSS will apply the appropriate mapping in the sprite PNG for the background image of the span.\n\n\nspan\n \nclass\n=\nemojione emojione-1f604\n \ntitle\n=\n:smile:\n\ud83d\ude04\n/\nspan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstr\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nClass(es) used for the span where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: \n'%(class)s-%(unicode)s'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\ndict\n\n\n{}\n\n\nA dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dict keys are the attribute names and dict values are the attribute values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_svg_sprite\n\n\n\n\nThis was written to support EmojiOne SVG sprite output.  The output form was taken directly from an example in the EmojiOne source.  It is expected that the the user will provide a local version of the official SVG sprite and the path to it.  The output is:\n\n\nsvg\n \nclass\n=\nemojione\ndescription\n\ud83d\ude04\n/\ndescription\nuse\n \nxlink:href\n=\n./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg#emoji-1f604\n/\nuse\n/\nsvg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerator Specific Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstr\n\n\nName of the index used\n\n\nClass(es) to apply to the svg element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: \n'%(class)s-%(unicode)s'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage_path\n\n\nstr\n\n\n'./../assets/sprites/emojione.sprites.svg'\n\n\nPath to the SVG sprites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_awesome\n\n\n\n\nThis generator is another EmojiOne specific output called \nEmojione Awesome\n.  According to EmojiOne's documentation, it aims to give a font-awesome like interface for EmojiOne.  There isn't currently a CDN link that could be found, but you can provide the CSS in your project locally by \ndownloading it\n from their repo.  The output format is:\n\n\ni\n \nclass\n=\ne1a-smile\n/\ni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclasses\n\n\nstr\n\n\n'e1a'\n\n\nClass(es) to apply to the svg element where the classes are inserted as \"class\" in the following template: \n'%(class)s-%(shortname)s'\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nattributes\n\n\ndict\n\n\n{}\n\n\nA dictionary containing tag attributes as key value string pairs. The dict keys are the attribute names and dict values are the attribute values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_alt\n\n\n\n\nThis generator supports both Gemoji and EmojiOne.  The generator outputs the alt value directly to the document.  The output can be Unicode characters, HTML entities, or even just the short name depending on what the global setting of 'alt' is set to.\n\n\n\ud83d\ude03\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no generator specific options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Emoji Indexes\n\n\nIn order to provide a custom index, the Emoji extension must be given a function that returns a suitable emoji index.  No parameters are passed to the function.  The function should simply return the custom index in the following format.\n\n\nemoji_index\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \n# Name is the name of the index.  This is passed into the emoji\n\n    \n# generator functions and can be used to differentiate logic\n\n    \n# for different indexes if required.\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nmyindex\n,\n\n\n    \n# The actual index.

The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator.\n\n\n\n\ndef emoji_generator(index, shortname, alias, uc, alt, title, options, md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\n\n\nstr\n\n\nThe name of the selected emoji index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshortname\n\n\nstr\n\n\nThe current short name.  This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalias\n\n\nstr\n\n\nIf the name specified in the document was an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under \nshortname\n.  This will be \nNone\n if the name used was not an alias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\nstr\n\n\nThis is a string of the Unicode values for the emoji.  This is used to reference emoji image names or for specifying class names etc., so it may not contain all the code points.  The string returned consists of each Unicode value represented as a hex value separated with hyphens.  Values such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and  U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 are stripped out.  So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be \nNone\n for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nstr\n\n\nThis is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting \nalt\n.  This will be returned as either the Unicode characters, HTML entities, or the short name used.

For example \n:octocat:\n will just return \nNone\n for \nuc\n and \n:octocat:\n for \nalt\n.  If you are parsing an index with custom emojis, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing with MkDocs\n\n\nThis project uses these extensions with \nMkDocs\n to generate the documentation.  It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in Mkdoc's YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy.  The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object.  For instance, to specify the \nto_svg\n generator, you would simply reference it like this: \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n (or you could use your own custom module).\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \npymdownx.emoji\n:\n\n      \nemoji_generator\n:\n \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoji Index Updates\n\n\nThe Emoji extension might not always have indexes built from the latest repos, we try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the repo to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance.  Pull requests are also welcome.  The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do for a pull request.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have \nrequests\n installed: \npip install requests\n.\n\n\nFork the repo and checkout to your machine.\n\n\nNavigate to the \"tools\" directory: \ncd pymdown-extensions/tools\n.\n\n\nCall the generator script: \npython gen_emoji --gemoji\n or \npython gen_emoji --emojione\n.  It will prompt you to select a tag to download.  Please pull the latest \nofficial\n tag.  Please don't pull experimental tags.  This should update the indexes.\n\n\nThen you want to update the tests.  Step back out to the root of the project: \ncd ..\n.\n\n\nForce the tests to update via \npython run_tests.py -fu\n.\n\n\n\n\nNothing is fool proof.  If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence).  If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nCurrent examples are all rendered with EmojiOne.\n\n\nEmojiOne :smile: emojis are very useful :thumbsup:.\n\nYou can also escape `:` characters to escape the emoji: \\:smile:.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne \n emojis are very useful \n.\n\n\nYou can also escape \n:\n characters to escape the emoji: :smile:.",

It can take percentages or fractions, and it can optionally generate classes for percentages at 20% levels.  It also works with Python Markdown's built in  attr_list  extension.  Though progress bars are rendered as block items, it accepts attr_list's inline format.  The basic syntax for progress bars is:  [=  percentage or fraction   optional single or double quoted title ] .  The opening  [  can be followed by one or more  =  characters. After the  =  char(s) the percentage is specified as either a fraction or percentage and can optionally be followed by a title surrounded in either double quotes or single quotes.",

The opening and closing fence markers must be indented at the same level.  If you are using a fenced block inside a blockquote, at the very least, the first line of the fenced block needs to have the appropriate number of \n characters signifying the quote depth.\n\n\n ```\n  a fenced block\n  ```\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that too many blank lines will cause a blockquote to terminate, so remember to use \n markers accordingly if not marking every line.\n\n\n ```\n  a fenced block\n\n\n with blank lines\n  ```\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using a fenced block as the first line of a list, you will have to leave the first line blank, but remember that the list marker must be followed by a space.\n\n\n-\nspace\n\n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\nDefinition\n:\nspace\n\n    ```\n    a fenced block\n    ```\n\n\n\n\n\nUML Diagrams\n\n\nWhen using the UML diagram features, you must provide the necessary JavaScript files for the HTML output.

They will be assigned the CSS classes \numl-flowchart\n and \numl-sequence-diagram\n respectively for flowcharts and sequence diagrams.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThis extension suffers from the same issues that the original fenced block extension suffers from.  Normally Python Markdown does not parse content inside HTML tags unless they are marked with the attribute \nmarkdown='1'\n.  But since this is run as a preprocessor, it is not aware of the HTML blocks.\n\n\nSuperFences is made to work with the default extensions out of the box.  It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes).  Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible.\n\n\nSuperFences works best when following the guidelines.

It will probably not work with other extensions such as Grid Tables, since that extension allows for characters to obscure the blocks like the blockquote syntax does (though this has been designed to work with blockquotes).  Ideally fenced blocks need to be handled by a block parser, but there is much work to be done on Python Markdown's internal block handlers before this is possible.

In order to style these we mainly remove the list type style and adjust the margins to align with normal list styles.  .markdown-body   .task-list-item   { \n   list-style-type :   none   !important ;  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-item   input [ type = checkbox ]   { \n   margin :   0   4px   0.25em   -20px ; \n   vertical-align :   middle ;  }   If custom checkbox icons are desired, custom styles can be used to give a unique look to the checkmarks.  Below is a very simple CSS example that creates a light gray square with rounded corners and displays a green Unicode check mark when the control is checked.  This can be adapted to use webfonts, images, etc.  .markdown-body   .task-list-item   { \n   list-style-type :   none   !important ;  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-item   input [ type = checkbox ]   { \n   margin :   0   4px   0.25em   -20px ; \n   vertical-align :   middle ;  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-control   { \n   display :   inline ;   /* Ensure label is inline incase theme sets it to block.*/  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-control   { \n   position :   relative ; \n   display :   inline - block ; \n   color :   #555 ; \n   cursor :   pointer ;  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-control   input [ type = checkbox ]   { \n   position :   absolute ; \n   opacity :   0 ; \n   z-index :   -1 ;   /* Put the input behind the label so it doesn t overlay text */  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-indicator   { \n   position :   absolute ; \n   top :   -8px ; \n   left :   -18px ; \n   display :   block ; \n   width :    14px ; \n   height :   14px ; \n   color :   #eee ; \n   background-color :   #eee ; \n   border - radius :   . 25 rem ;  }  .markdown-body   .task-list-control   input [ type = checkbox ] :checked   +   .task-list-indicator : :before   { \n   display :   block ; \n   margin-top :   -4px ; \n   margin-left :   2px ; \n   font-size :   16px ; \n   line-height :   1 ; \n   content :   \u2714 ; \n   color :   #1EBB52 ;  }",
