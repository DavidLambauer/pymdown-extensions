            "text": "Overview\n\ue157\n\n\nArithmatex is an extension that preserves LaTeX math equations during the Markdown conversion process so that they can be used with \nMathJax\n. It searches for the patterns \n$\n...\n$\n and \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n for inline math, and \n$$\n...\n$$\n, \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n for block math. By default, all formats are enabled, but they each format can individually be disabled if desired.\n\n\nKeep in mind that some equations can make it through without Arithmatex fine.  Arithmatex is meant to \nensure\n they make it through.\n\n\nInput Format\n\ue157\n\n\nFor the \n$\n...\n$\n inline variant, it is expected that the opening token (\n$\n) is to be followed by a non-whitespace character, and the closing to be preceded by a non-white-space character.  This is to help avoid false positives when using the dollar sign in traditional ways such as: I have $2.00 and Bob has $10.00.  The previous statement requires no escaping of the \n$\n character.  But when needed, the \n$\n character can be escaped using \n\\$\n.\n\n\nFor block forms, the block must start with the appropriate opening for the block type: \n$$\n, \n\\[\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n for the respective search pattern. The block must also end with the proper respective end: \n$$\n, \n\\]\n, and \n\\end\n{}\n. A block also must contain no empty lines and should be both preceded and followed by an empty line.\n\n\nOutput Format\n\ue157\n\n\nIf \ninsert_as_script\n is enabled, the math equations will be wrapped in a special MathJax script tag and embedded into the HTML. MathJax can already find these scripts, so there is no need to configure the \ntex2jax\n extension when setting up MathJax. The tag will be \nscript\n \ntype\n=\nmath/tex\n/\nscript\n for inline and \nscript\n \ntype\n=\nmath/tex; mode=display\n/\nscript\n for block. This is probably the most reliable HTML form, but if MathJax doesn't load, you don't get fallback text.  When \ninsert_as_script\n is enabled, \ntex_inline_wrap\n and \ntex_block_wrap\n are ignored.\n\n\nOn output, if \ninsert_as_script\n is \nFalse\n, the extension will escape necessary symbols and normalize all output to be wrapped in the more reliable \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n for inline math and \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n for block math. Then the wrapped content will be inserted into a \nspan\n and embedded into the HTML.  The span provides a container to keep MathJax from gathering multiple equations into one by mistake.  So, with the default settings, if in your Markdown you used \n$\n...\n$\n, it would be converted to \n\\(\n...\n\\)\n in the HTML. Blocks would respectively be normalized from \n$$\n...\n$$\n to \n\\[\n...\n\\]\n.  In the case of \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n, begins and ends will not be replaced, only wrapped\n\\[\n\\begin\n{}...\n\\end\n{}\n\\]\n. Normalization is provided as MathJax disables detection of \n$\n...\n$\n by default due to detection issues with money notation.  Since Arithmatex provides additional logic to curb issues with \n$\n, we allow it in the Markdown. If a different wrapper is desired, see \nOptions\n below to learn how to change the wrapper.\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninline_syntax\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\ndollar\n,\n \nround\n]\n\n\nSyntax to search for: dollar=\n$\n...\n$\n and round=\n\\(\n...\n\\)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblock_syntax\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\ndollar\n,\n \nsquare\n,\n \nbegin\n]\n\n\nSyntax to search for: dollar=\n$\n...\n$\n, square=\n\\[\n...\n\\]\n, and \n\\begin\n{}\n...\n\\end\n{}\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntex_inline_wrap\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\n\\\\\n(\n,\n \n\\\\\n)\n]\n\n\nAn array containing the opening and closing portion of the wrap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntex_block_wrap\n\n\n[\nstring\n]\n\n\n[\n\\\\\n[\n,\n \n\\\\\n]\n]\n\n\nAn array containing the opening and closing portion of the wrap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninsert_as_script\n\n\nbool\n\n\nFalse\n\n\nInstead of using the above wrap options, insert the equations in a \nmath/tex\n script. This form is the most reliable in HTML, but if the MathJax script fails to load, the user won't see any indication of the equations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping Format\n\n\nVersion \n1.7.0\n: Arithmatex, when \ninsert_as_script\n is \nFalse\n, now runs the wrap options through an HTML escaper and then everything is wrapped in a \nspan\n. This is to isolate equations and prevent them from bleeding into each other when MathJax parses the HTML. Though this is a more aggressive change, it is to meant to provide more reliable output.\n\n\n\n\nLoading MathJax\n\ue157\n\n\nArithmatex requires you to provide the MathJax library and provide and configure it to your liking.  The recommended way of including MathJax is to use the CDN.\n\n\nscript\n \nsrc\n=\nhttps://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js\n/\nscript\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to load one of the pre-defined configurations that MathJax offers, you can do as shown below.

It allows for the removal or acceptance of the critic modifications and modifies the source to reflect the rejection or approval (highlights and comments are stripped in both cases).  It also allows for visually displaying the changes in HTML output (\nmileage may vary\n).\n\n\nOptions\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\n\n\nType\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmode\n\n\nstring\n\n\nview\n\n\nview\n just parses the markup and displays it in its HTML equivalent rendering.  \naccept\n strips out the critic markup and replaces them with the suggested changes.  \nreject\n rejects all the suggestions and strips the critic markup out replacing it with the original.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations with Previewing Critic Markup\n\ue157\n\n\nParsing CriticMarkup is very straight forward.  If you need to reject critic marks or accept them, the Critic extension will work quite well.  But when trying to render the edits visually \nand\n trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here: \nhttp://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup\n.\n\n\nThe Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.\n\n\nExamples\n\ue157\n\n\nMarkup\nExample\ndelete\ndelete\ninsert\ninsert\ndelete and replace with substitutions\ndelete and replace\nsubstitutions\nhighlight\nhighlight\ncomment\ntext\ncomment\n\n\n\nHere they are in action:\n\n\nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \n{--*incorrect*--}\n \nMarkdown.\n  \nI\n \nam\n \nadding\n \nthis\n{++ here.++}\n.\n  \nHere\n \nis\n \nsome\n \nmore\n \n{--text\n\n\n that I am removing--}\ntext.\n  \nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \neven\n \nmore\n \n{++text that I \n\n\n am ++}\nadding.\n{~~\n\n\n\n~\n  ~~}\nParagraph\n \nwas\n \ndeleted\n \nand\n \nreplaced\n \nwith\n \nsome\n \nspaces.\n{~~  ~\n\n\n\n~~}\nSpaces\n \nwere\n \nremoved\n \nand\n \na\n \nparagraph\n \nwas\n \nadded.\n\nAnd\n \nhere\n \nis\n \na\n \ncomment\n \non\n \n{==some\n\n\n ==text== ==}{\nThis works quite well.

But when trying to render the edits visually  and  trying to convert the document to HTML, things can get ugly.  I think this is the one unfortunate problem with CriticMarkup.  The existence of the critic edits can alter the actual source.  Its a fantastic idea, but it should be understood that when using CriticMarkup beyond inline or block paragraphs, there is a possibility that invalid HTML will be created for the preview (especially in relation to lists or if breaking up Markdown syntax).  I think Fletcher said it best here:  http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/criticmarkup .  The Critic extension does its best by employing a preprocessor to inject the critic tags before all other parsing and a post-processor to clean up some of the weird side effects of the injection (only selected odd cases as others are more difficult to fix).  It injects some classes into the edit region's HTML output which allows for CSS styling.  There is probably a lot more post-processing that could be done to fix more issues, but whether this extension will be going further down that road has not yet been decided.",

            "text": "Overview\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension adds support for inserting emojis via simple short names enclosed within colons: \n:short_name:\n.  This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to the Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements that represent the emoji.\n\n\nThere are a number of familiar emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of, and they differ slightly.  At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on two specific short name conventions. The first convention is from \nGemoji\n which is GitHub's open source solution that provides emojis in \nGFM\n.  The second is from \nEmojiOne\n which is another open source emoji solution.\n\n\nThe short name indexes simply provide easy to remember names mapped to the Unicode data. Custom emojis (like Gemoji's \n:octocat:\n) wold have no Unicode data associated with them and would only provide a long name.  While it may be thought that an index like Gemoji is only for GitHub emoji images, you could easily map EmojiOne images to the Gemoji short names and vice versa. You could even map \nTwemoji\n images to EmojiOne if desired.\n\n\nEmoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Most hosted emoji images follow the same pattern and are named after their Unicode code points separated by hyphens (minus things like zero width joiners and variation selectors).  This is true with EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji, to name a few.  The default output \nto_png\n could theoretically be used with the EmojiOne index to output valid PNG images for EmojiOne, GitHub, or Twemoji (assuming appropriate CDN or local source images were provided). With that said, some output formats may lend themselves better to assets that are available from a specific provider. For instance, EmojiOne provides SVG, PNG, and sprite assets, while others provide only PNG images.\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, short name indexes are sourced from EmojiOne's and Gemoji's latest official tags. The index contains the emoji names, shortnames, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements.\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne and Gemoji licensing\n\n\nPyMdown Extensions has no affiliation with EmojiOne or Gemoji.

Both indexes are generated from the most recent official release tag source. They can be used by passing in one of the two functions below via the \nemoji_index\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Indexes\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.emojione\n\n\n\n\nThis is the default function that is used and provides an index using the latest EmojiOne supported emojis (at the time of release).

All the generators can be used with the \nemojione\n index, but only two will work well with the \ngemoji\n index: \npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n and \npymdownx.emoji.to_alt\n. You can select a generator to use by passing in one of the functions below via the \nemoji_generator\n parameter.  Pass the actual function reference, not a string. If you need to create your own, just check out \nCustom Emoji Generators\n.\n\n\n\n\npymdownx.emoji.to_png\n\n\n\n\nThis is a general purpose generator and, by default, provides an EmojiOne CDN and GitHub CDN path(s).

The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator.\n\n\n\n\ndef\n \nemoji_generator\n(\nindex\n,\n \nshortname\n,\n \nalias\n,\n \nuc\n,\n \nalt\n,\n \ntitle\n,\n \noptions\n,\n \nmd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe name of the selected emoji index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshortname\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThe current short name.  This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalias\n\n\nstring\n\n\nIf the name specified in the document was an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under \nshortname\n.  This will be \nNone\n if the name used was not an alias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuc\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is a string of the Unicode values for the emoji.  This is used to reference emoji image names or for specifying class names etc., so it may not contain all the code points.  The string returned consists of each Unicode value represented as a hex value separated with hyphens.  Values such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and  U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 are stripped out.  So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be \nNone\n for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalt\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting \nalt\n.  This will be returned as either the Unicode characters, HTML entities, or the short name used.  See the \nalt\n setting for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nstring\n\n\nThis is the title that can be used in image elements.  Depending on the global extension setting \ntitle\n, this will either return the long name, the short name, or \nNone\n.  See the \ntitle\n setting for more info.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptions\n\n\ndictionary\n\n\nThis is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options.  This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmd\n\n\nclass\n\n\nThis is the Markdown class object.  This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class.  If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like: \nmd.htmlStash.store(alt, safe=True)\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Unicode emojis\n\n\nKeep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emojis like \n:octocat:\n that do not have Unicode code points.  \nuc\n and \nalt\n are affected by this and will return \nNone\n and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points.  For example \n:octocat:\n will just return \nNone\n for \nuc\n and \n:octocat:\n for \nalt\n.  If you are parsing an index with custom emojis, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing with MkDocs\n\ue157\n\n\nThis project uses these extensions with \nMkDocs\n to generate the documentation.  It might not be obvious how to set the index or generator functions in Mkdoc's YAML settings file, but it is actually pretty easy.  The functions are referenced like you would import them in Python except you also append them with a special prefix to let the YAML module know that the setting value is a Python object.  For instance, to specify the \nto_svg\n generator, you would simply reference it like this: \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n (or you could use your own custom module).\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \npymdownx.emoji\n:\n\n      \nemoji_generator\n:\n \n!!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoji Index Updates\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension might at times be behind on having indexes built from the latest repositories. We try to keep the indexes updated with new releases, but if they fall out of date, you can open an issue on the this project's issue page to alert the maintainer(s) and they will update them when someone gets a chance.  Pull requests are also welcome.  The process for updating the indexes is automated, so it is fairly easy to do for a pull request.  See \nGenerating Emoji Indexes\n for more info.\n\n\nExamples\n\ue157\n\n\nCurrent examples are all rendered with EmojiOne.\n\n\nEmojiOne :smile: emojis are very useful :thumbsup:.\n\nYou can also escape `:` characters to escape the emoji: \\:smile:.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmojiOne \n emojis are very useful \n.\n\n\nYou can also escape \n:\n characters to escape the emoji: :smile:.",

            "text": "The Emoji extension adds support for inserting emojis via simple short names enclosed within colons:  :short_name: .  This is accomplished by using a short name index to map easy to remember names to the Unicode data. The Unicode data is then converted into actual Unicode emoji characters and/or special HTML elements that represent the emoji.  There are a number of familiar emoji short name conventions that people may be aware of, and they differ slightly.  At the present, Emoji chooses to focus on two specific short name conventions. The first convention is from  Gemoji  which is GitHub's open source solution that provides emojis in  GFM .  The second is from  EmojiOne  which is another open source emoji solution.  The short name indexes simply provide easy to remember names mapped to the Unicode data. Custom emojis (like Gemoji's  :octocat: ) wold have no Unicode data associated with them and would only provide a long name.  While it may be thought that an index like Gemoji is only for GitHub emoji images, you could easily map EmojiOne images to the Gemoji short names and vice versa. You could even map  Twemoji  images to EmojiOne if desired.  Emoji provides various output formats that take the Unicode data associated with a short name (or the short name itself in the case of a custom emoji) and generates an HTML output. Most hosted emoji images follow the same pattern and are named after their Unicode code points separated by hyphens (minus things like zero width joiners and variation selectors).  This is true with EmojiOne, GitHub, and Twemoji, to name a few.  The default output  to_png  could theoretically be used with the EmojiOne index to output valid PNG images for EmojiOne, GitHub, or Twemoji (assuming appropriate CDN or local source images were provided). With that said, some output formats may lend themselves better to assets that are available from a specific provider. For instance, EmojiOne provides SVG, PNG, and sprite assets, while others provide only PNG images.  As previously mentioned, short name indexes are sourced from EmojiOne's and Gemoji's latest official tags. The index contains the emoji names, shortnames, values, etc.; everything needed to insert Unicode emoji characters or specially crafted HTML elements.

The format is shown below in case you need to create your own custom output generator.   def   emoji_generator ( index ,   shortname ,   alias ,   uc ,   alt ,   title ,   options ,   md )      Parameter  Type  Description      index  string  The name of the selected emoji index.    shortname  string  The current short name.  This may differ from the actual name used in a document as aliases get translated to the main short name.    alias  string  If the name specified in the document was an alias, that alias will be set here, and the main short name will be found under  shortname .  This will be  None  if the name used was not an alias.    uc  string  This is a string of the Unicode values for the emoji.  This is used to reference emoji image names or for specifying class names etc., so it may not contain all the code points.  The string returned consists of each Unicode value represented as a hex value separated with hyphens.  Values such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER and  U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16 are stripped out.  So the value here will not always be practical for calculating the actual Unicode points of an emoji.  This will be  None  for non-standard emoji that are not Unicode.    alt  string  This is the alternative emoji value (or fallback value).  Its format will differ depending on the extension setting  alt .  This will be returned as either the Unicode characters, HTML entities, or the short name used.  See the  alt  setting for more info.    title  string  This is the title that can be used in image elements.  Depending on the global extension setting  title , this will either return the long name, the short name, or  None .  See the  title  setting for more info.    options  dictionary  This is a dictionary to specify generator function specific options.  This can be anything, and it is up to the generator function to parse and provide defaults.    md  class  This is the Markdown class object.  This is mainly used to access specific things needed from the Markdown class.  If you needed to stash your output, you would do something like:  md.htmlStash.store(alt, safe=True) .      Non-Unicode emojis  Keep in mind that Gemoji ships with some non-standard emojis like  :octocat:  that do not have Unicode code points.   uc  and  alt  are affected by this and will return  None  and the short name respectively instead of strings describing the Unicode points.  For example  :octocat:  will just return  None  for  uc  and  :octocat:  for  alt .  If you are parsing an index with custom emojis, like Gemoji has, then you need to be aware of this.",

If GitHub changes their slugs, you can always write your own to be more like theirs.    Output Change  HeaderAnchor is no longer included starting in version  1.4.0  as it wasn't really part of the  GFM  syntax, and HeaderAnchor is now deprecated.  HeaderAnchor is an unnecessary extension, and the same end result can be achieved with  markdown.extensions.toc  (with the  permalink  option enabled) and some custom CSS.  This extension was more about the syntax than it was about styling.  If you are not ready to give up the extension, you can manually include the  pymdownx.headeranchor  extension in addition to  pymdownx.github . But in the future, the HeaderAnchor extension will be removed from PyMdown Extensions.",

Borrowing from CodeHilite's existing syntax, InlineHilite utilizes the following syntax to insert inline highlighted code: \n`:::language mycode`\n or \n`#!language mycode`\n.  We will call these specifiers (\n#!language\n and \n:::language\n) mock shebangs.\n\n\nWhen using the colon mock shebang, 3 or more colons can be used.  Mock shebangs must come \nimmediately\n after the opening backtick(s) and must be followed by at least one space.  If you need to escape a mock shebang at the start of a code block, just put a space before it and it will be treated as part of the code.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf using Pygments, the elements should be highlighted just fine, but you may need to adjust CSS to get the general style of the inline block the way you like it.\n\n\nIf you are using a JavaScript highlighter such as \nhighlight.js\n you will most likely need to construct a JavaScript method to target the inline blocks.  You may also find it useful to tag inline blocks with a different class than the block highlighted code so you can also target and style them with CSS differently.

Borrowing from CodeHilite's existing syntax, InlineHilite utilizes the following syntax to insert inline highlighted code:  `:::language mycode`  or  `#!language mycode` .  We will call these specifiers ( #!language  and  :::language ) mock shebangs.  When using the colon mock shebang, 3 or more colons can be used.  Mock shebangs must come  immediately  after the opening backtick(s) and must be followed by at least one space.  If you need to escape a mock shebang at the start of a code block, just put a space before it and it will be treated as part of the code.   Tip  If using Pygments, the elements should be highlighted just fine, but you may need to adjust CSS to get the general style of the inline block the way you like it.  If you are using a JavaScript highlighter such as  highlight.js  you will most likely need to construct a JavaScript method to target the inline blocks.  You may also find it useful to tag inline blocks with a different class than the block highlighted code so you can also target and style them with CSS differently.  InlineHilite allows you to have a different  css_class  than what is used by  CodeHilite .",

It can take percentages or fractions, and it can optionally generate classes for percentages at 20% levels.  It also works with Python Markdown's built in \nattr_list\n extension.

The PyMdown Extensions project utilizes the flake8 linter (with some additional plugins) to ensure code conforms (give or take some of the rules).  When in doubt follow the formatting hints of existing code when adding or modifying files. existing files.  Listed below are the modules used:\n\n\n\n\nflake8\n\n\nflake8_docstrings\n\n\npep8-naming\n\n\n\n\nFlake8 can be run directly via the command line from the root of the project.\n\n\nflake8\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Documents\n\ue157\n\n\nDocuments are in Markdown (with with some additional syntax) and converted to HTML via Python Markdown and this extension bundle. If you would like to build and preview the documentation, you must have these packages installed:\n\n\n\n\nPython Markdown\n: the Markdown parser.\n\n\nMkDocs\n: the document site generator.\n\n\nMaterial\n: a material theme for MkDocs.\n\n\nPyMdown Extensions: this Python Markdown extension bundle.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to build and preview the documents, just run the following from the root of the project and you should be able to view the docs at \nlocalhost:8000\n in your browser (assuming you have the dependencies installed).\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell Checking Documents\n\ue157\n\n\nDuring validation we build the docs and run a spell checker on them.  The spell checker script uses \nAspell\n.  Currently this project uses the latest Aspell.  As the latest Aspell is not available on Windows, it is not expected that everyone will install and run Aspell locally.  In order to perform the spell check, it is expected you are setup to build the documents, and that you have Aspell installed in the your system path. To initiate the spell check run the following command from the root of the project:\n\n\npython spelling.py\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should print out the files with the misspelled words if any are found.  If you find it prints words that are not misspelled, you can add them in \n.dictionary\n in the root of the project.\n\n\nValidation Tests\n\ue157\n\n\nIn order to preserve good code health, a test suite has been put together with \npytest\n. There are currently two kinds of tests: syntax and targeted.  To run these tests, you can use the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax\n\ue157\n\n\nSyntax tests are essentially text files containing Markdown. They are found under \ntests/extensions\n.  \ntest_syntax.py\n scans all the files and converts the files to HTML with the extensions and options defined in \ntests/extensions/tests.yml\n.  They are then compared to the current stored HTML output.  If the two differ, the test fails.\n\n\nTo run \nonly\n these tests, from the root of the project run the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target syntax\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also run them directly with:\n\n\npy.test tests/test_syntax.py\n\n\n\n\n\nTo run a specific syntax test:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target syntax --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nTo accept the differences in tests due to a change(s) you made, you can run the following command:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --update\n\n\n\n\n\nTo update and accept the differences in a single test:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --update --file tests/extensions/arithmatex.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeted\n\ue157\n\n\nTargeted tests are unit tests that target specific areas in the code and exercises them to ensure proper functionality.  These tests are found in \ntest_targeted.py\n.\n\n\nYou can run \nonly\n these tests from the root of the project with:\n\n\npython run_tests.py --test-target targeted\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could also run them directly with:\n\n\npy.test tests/test_targeted.py\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning Validation With Tox\n\ue157\n\n\nTox\n is a great way to run the validation tests, spelling checks, and linting in virtual environments so as not to mess with your current working environment. Tox will use the specified Python version for the given environment and create a virtual environment and install all the needed requirements (minus Aspell).  You could also setup your own virtual environments with the Virtualenv module without Tox, and manually do the same.\n\n\nFirst, you need to have Tox installed:\n\n\npip install tox\n\n\n\n\n\nBy running Tox, it will walk through all the environments and create them (assuming you have all the python versions on your machine) and run the related tests.  See \ntox.ini\n to learn more.\n\n\ntox\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have all the Python versions needed to test all the environments, those entries will fail.  You can ignore those.  Spelling will also fail if you don't have the correct version of Aspell.\n\n\nTo target a specific environment to test, you use the \n-e\n option to select the environment of interest.  To select lint:\n\n\ntox -elint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select PY27 unit tests (or other versions \n change accordingly):\n\n\ntox -epy27-unittests\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select spelling:\n\n\ntox -espelling\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Coverage\n\ue157\n\n\nWhen running the validation tests through Tox, it is setup to track code coverage via the \ncoverage\n module.  Coverage is run on each \npyxx-unittests\n environment.  If you've made changes to the code, you can clear the old coverage data:\n\n\ncoverage erase\n\n\n\n\n\nThen run each unit test environment to and coverage will be calculated. All the data from each run is merged together.  HTML is output for each file in \n.tox/pyXX-unittests/tmp\n.  You can use these to see areas that are not covered/exercised yet with testing.\n\n\nYou can checkout \ntox.ini\n to see how this is accomplished.\n\n\nGenerating Emoji Indexes\n\ue157\n\n\nThe Emoji extension has emoji indexes generated from the source of Gemoji and EmojiOne.  Below is the process for auto-generating these indexes.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have \nRequests\n installed: \npip install requests\n.\n\n\nFork the repository and checkout to your machine.\n\n\nNavigate to the root of the project.\n\n\nCall the generator script: \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --gemoji\n or \npython tools/gen_emoji.py --emojione\n.  It will prompt you to select a tag to download.  Please pull the latest \nofficial\n tag.  Please don't pull experimental tags.  This should update the indexes.\n\n\nThen you want to update the tests.\n\n\nForce the tests to update via \npython run_tests.py --update\n.\n\n\n\n\nNothing is fool proof.  If they make a breaking change to the files that the script parses, or the location of the files change, the auto-update tool may need to be updated itself (hopefully this would be a rare occurrence).  If such a change does occur, and you are feeling brave, a pull request would be appreciated, but in time, they will be resolved regardless.",
